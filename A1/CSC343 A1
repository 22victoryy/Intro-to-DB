Collection(CID, date, SID)
Tuples here represent entire collections from a field trip, where CID is the collection ID, date is the
starting date of the field trip, and SID is the staff ID of the collector.


Collected(CID, AN)
A tuple here represents the fact that collection CID includes artifact number AN. A single collection usually contains multiple artifacts, and a single artifact may be aggregated from more than one
collection.

Artifact(AN, species, type, location, SID)
Tuples here represent single artifact collected in the field. AN is the artifact number, species is the
scientific species name, type is one of tissue, image, model, or live, location is where it was collected,
and SID is the staff number of the technician who maintains this artifact.

Published(AN, journal, date)
A tuple here represents the fact that artifact AN was mentioned in scholarly publication journal with
publication date date.

Staff(SID, name, email, rank, date)
These tuples represent a member of the institute's scientific staff. SID is the staff ID, name is their
full name, email is their professional email, rank is one of: technician, student, pre-tenure, or tenured,
and date is the date when they attained that rank.

COL(family)
A singleton tuple here means that family is a scientific zoological family name that appears in the
Catalogue of Life.

Genus(genus, family)
A tuple here means that genus is in family family.

Species(species, genus)
A tuple here means that species is in genus genus.


----------------------------
Constraints (middle --> attr of inside the parenthesis)

project-species(Artifact) - project-species(Species) = 0 --> project-species(Artifact) <= project-species(Species)
- Every species in Artifact must be at least one species.

project-staff(Rank) <=  {'technician', 'student', 'pre-tenure', 'tenure'}
- Every staff in Rank must be either a technician, student, pre-tenue, or tenure.
